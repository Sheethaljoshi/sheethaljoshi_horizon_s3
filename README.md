# Question 1

Question: 
In any programming language, write a code that constantly inputs a number and shows the average of all numbers inserted but does not accept a number that is repeated.

Sample Input & Output:

Input: 4

Output: 4

Input: 5

Output: 4.5

Input :5

Output:4.5

## How to Run the Program

1. Clone or download the program from the GitHub repository to your local system.

2. Ensure you have Python installed on your computer.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt on your system.

4. Navigate to the directory where you've stored the program files using the `cd` command.

5. Run the program by entering the following command: python 1.py

6. The program will start, and you'll be prompted to input numbers. You can type "stop" to exit the program or "restart" to reset the ongoing average to zero.

7. To calculate the ongoing average, input valid numbers. The program will display the current average as you go.

8. The program will terminate with a message when you decide to stop it.

## Program Logic

The program initializes two variables, `count` and `tot`, to keep track of the numbers entered and their sum. It uses a while loop to repeatedly take user input.

- Input "stop" to exit the program.
- Input "restart" to reset the ongoing average to zero.
- Input valid numbers to calculate and display the ongoing average.
- For invalid input, the program displays an error message and prompts for another input.

Remember to type your inputs exactly as shown (case-insensitive) for the program to recognize them.

**Happy calculating!**
